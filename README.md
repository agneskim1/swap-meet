# Swap Meet

You want to organize a swap meet! You own a lot of things. So do your friends! It would be awesome if each person could swap one of their things with another person's things.

For this event, you want each person to register online as a vendor. Also, they should be able to add a list of things as their inventory.

This way the vendors can swap items between different inventories. 

The Vendor class will have an argument of inventory. There will be instance methods that can add or remove items from the vendor's inventory.

You can also get an item by it's id and an category that is assoicated with the item.

By using the Vendor's instance method named swap-items you can swap items between the vendor and other vendor(True). If the item doesn't exist in either of the inventories, the swap cannot be completed and the output will be false. 

You can also swap items that are the first in the inventory or even if it's the best condition in it's category.
